# blame-history
A tool that analyses the commit history for a file and builds a history for every line in that file.

## Setup

Make sure you have the latest [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) installed (which includes [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)). Then clone the project, run `npm install` in the root directory, followed by `npm test` to run the code.

To test with another file then the default one you can run `npm test -- --file test.js`.
